## Harassment

**We do not tolerate harassment in any form.** Examples of harassment include:

  status, nationality, personal appearance, race, ethnicity, caste, color,
  religion, or sexual identity and orientation
- Unwelcome comments regarding others' lifestyle choices and practices,
  including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment
- Deliberate misgendering, using "dead" or rejected names, or refusing to use
  the correct pronouns for anyone
- [Microaggressions], which take the form of everyday jokes, put-downs, and/or
  insults that carry judgmental or stereotypical implications towards
  marginalized groups
- Threats, deliberate intimidation, or incitement of violence (including
  encouraging anyone to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm)
- Unwelcome sexual attention, or gratuitous sexual images/behaviors in spaces
  where they aren't appropriate
- Physical contact or simulated physical contact (including textual descriptions
  such as "\*hug\*" or "\*backrub\*") without consent, or after a request to
  stop
- Patterns of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting or assuming
  inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
- Persistent communication (or disruption of others' communication) after a
  request to stop
- Stalking or unwelcome following (e.g. across websites or communication
  methods)
- Logging or investigating someone's online activity for harassment purposes
- Nonconsensual photography or recording, including posting pictures or videos
  of others for harassment purposes
- Deliberate "outing" of any aspect of anyone's identity or private
  communications without their consent, except as necessary to protect
  vulnerable people from intentional abuse

## Non-Issues

The administrator will **not** act on complaints regarding:

- Alleged reverse-isms, including "reverse racism", "reverse sexism", and
  "cisphobia"
- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone," "go away,"
  or "I'm not discussing this with you"
- Communicating in a "tone" you don't find congenial
- Criticism of racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or
  assumptions

If you find yourself reaching to complain about any of these things, **you're**
the problem.

## Reporting

If you are being harassed by a member of Cutie City, notice that someone else is
being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the administrator
directly (via [DM] or [email]) and/or file a report using Mastodon's built-in
system (click the "â€¦" button on a post for the "Report" option).

The administrator reserves the right to exclude people from Cutie City based on
their past behavior, including behavior outside Cutie City spaces and behavior
towards people who are not members of Cutie City. We will not name harassment
victims without their affirmative consent.

## Consequences

When asked to cease any harassing behavior, participants are expected to comply
immediately. Depending on the severity and persistency of the harassment, the
administrator may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including
expulsion from all Cutie City spaces as well as identification of the
participant as a harasser to other Cutie City members or the general public.

The administrator reserves the right to update this page at any time, at their
discretion. Nontrivial updates will be communicated via posts from the official
